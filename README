libmidireader is a very simple library created for reading and writing MIDI files. It is designed to be quick to use and quick to learn. All interaction should be done through the MIDI::File class, which parses a MIDI file. The data inside the MIDI::File class is then organized as if it were a normal MIDI file.

Installation
--
libmidi uses the CMake build system. So to compile it, one has to issue the following commands inside the libmidireader-0.1 directory.

mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
sudo make install
